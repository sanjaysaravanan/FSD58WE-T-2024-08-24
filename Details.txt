Topics:

  1. Frontend:
      the module which user will interact, html, css, js
      makes request to the some private or public APIs 
      which will give the contents to be rendered

    Database

    API --> Application Programming Interface

    Backend is the system where APIs will be running

     Backend: REST API - Representational State Transfer
      system which lets us communicate with Database for doing CRUD operations

      Why need a backend system:
        1. separating the Front-end layer and data layer
        2. ease of data maniupulation and in-memory access ( which is not possible in browser )
        3. secure querying of the data layer

  2. what is nodejs:
    
    nodejs is a js runtime environment, where we can execute js without web browser

    1. blocking i/o or synchronous operations
    2. Non Blocking i/o or asynchronous operations ( Error First Callback to track finish the operation )

    running js file in nodejs environment:
      cannot access window functions/attributes like alert, prompt, confirm, document because they can only be used in web browser
    
    BrowserJS - this === window

    global var --> console.log(global);
      utils related nodejs backend

    command line arguements: ( space separated word in the command line )
      - process.argv
        custom arguements should be taken from second index value
      - Getting Inputs from CMD line arguements
  
  2.1 ES module, Common Js

    Modularization and reusing the codes

    exporting and importing of the codes

    Common JS:
      JS used before ES

      exporting:

        files end,

        module.exports = {
          // items to be exported
          <>,
          <>
        }
      
      importing:

        const name = require('<file-path>/module');
    
    ES Module:

      exporting:

        export, export default

      importing:

        import utils from "utils";
        default import
        import utils, { add, sub, mul } from "utils";
  
  3. inbuilt module/package as utility
      
      - OS - operating system
        reading memory and system info

      - fs - file system
        create new files in the file system
        create files using for loop
        readFile with and without encoding
        appendFile and appendFile with newline
        deletefile - unlink

      Timestamp or Date Formats
        Timestamp:
          Date.now(); // timestamp

        Date Time:
          Date().toString(); 
          // Date format 
          ( Sat Dec 02 2023 12:07:57 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time) )
          new Date().toISOString(); 
          // Date format 
          ( 2023-12-02T06:38:44.231Z )

  module hoisting behavior
  4. using external third party library,

    npm:
      node package manager

    in nodejs, in order to use the third party library from open source.

      step 0: Create a required folder

      step1: npm init ( run in the created folder )
      
      -> create a new node project where we can install third party packages

      step 2:
        npm install <third-party-package>
      We need a npm project with the packages under dependency

      what is npm -> node package manager ( like play store ), 
      node_modules ( executable( moduled js )/binary of the third party packages )
      
      examples:
        lodash

  files using timestamp & datetime formats
  
  express - web framework http server applcation which lets us create APIs
      and use those APIs in our application

      sample API using express
